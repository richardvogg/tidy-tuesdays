I wanted to analyze the judges of the Show Chopped when I noticed that there were a lot of typos in their names.

For example Amanda Freitag appeared sometimes as Amanda Freita or Amanda Frietag.
With the help of the stringdist package, I was able to replace those fuzzy duplicates with the real name (the most frequent one).
